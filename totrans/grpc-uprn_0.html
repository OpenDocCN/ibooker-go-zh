<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Nowadays software applications are often connected with each other over computer networks using inter-process communication technologies. gRPC is a modern inter-process communication style based on high-performance RPCs (remote procedure calls) for building distributed applications and microservices. With the advent of microservices and cloud native applications, the adoption of gRPC is exponentially growing.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why Did We Write This Book?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With the increasing adoption of gRPC, we felt that developers need a comprehensive book on gRPC, a book that you can use as the ultimate reference guide in every stage of the development cycle of your gRPC applications. There are a lot of resources and code samples for gRPC all over the place (documentation, blogs, articles, conference talks, and so on), but there’s no single resource that you can use to build gRPC applications. Also, there aren’t any resources on the internals of the gRPC protocol and how it works under the hood.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We wrote this book to overcome those challenges and give you a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of gRPC, how it differs from conventional inter-process communication technologies, real-world gRPC communication patterns, how to build gRPC applications using Go and Java, how it works under the hood, how to run gRPC applications in production, and how gRPC works with Kubernetes and the rest of the ecosystem.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Is This Book For?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The book is most directly relevant to developers who are building distributed applications and microservices using different inter-process communication technologies. When it comes to building such applications and services, developers need to learn the fundamentals of gRPC, when and how to use it for inter-service communication, best practices for running gRPC services in production, and so on.&#13;
Also, architects who are adopting microservices or cloud native architecture and designing how the services should communicate will get a lot of insight from the book because it compares and contrasts gRPC with other technologies and provides guidelines on when to use and when to avoid it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We assume that both developers and architects have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of distributed computing such as inter-process communication techniques, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and microservices.</p>&#13;

<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The book is written in such a way that the theoretical concepts are explained using real-world use cases. Throughout the book, we have extensively used code examples featuring Go and Java to give readers hands-on experience with each of the concepts that they learn. We have organized the book into eight chapters.</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.html#grpc_ch_01">Chapter 1, <em>Introduction to gRPC</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter gives you a basic understanding of gRPC fundamentals and compares it with similar inter-process communication styles such as REST, GraphQL, and other RPC technologies.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.html#ch_02">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started with gRPC</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter is where you get the first hands-on experience with building a complete gRPC application using either Go or Java.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.html#ch_03">Chapter 3, <em>gRPC Communication Patterns</em></a></dt>&#13;

<p>In this chapter, you will explore gRPC communication patterns using real-world examples.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.html#ch_04">Chapter 4, <em>gRPC: Under the Hood</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>If you are an advanced gRPC user interested in knowing the internals of gRPC, this is the chapter to learn them. This chapter teaches you every step of gRPC communication between server and client and how it works over the network.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.html#ch_05">Chapter 5, <em>gRPC: Beyond the Basics</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter teaches you some of the most important advanced features of gRPC such as interceptors, deadlines, metadata, multiplexing, load balancing, and so on.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.html#ch_06">Chapter 6, <em>Secured gRPC</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter gives you a comprehensive understanding of how to secure communication channels and how we authenticate and control the access of users to gRPC applications.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.html#ch_07">Chapter 7, <em>Running gRPC in Production</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This chapter walks you through the entire development life cycle of gRPC applications. We cover testing gRPC applications, integration with CI/CD, deploying and running on Docker and Kubernetes, and observing gRPC applications.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.html#ch_08">Chapter 8, <em>The gRPC Ecosystem</em></a></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we discuss some of the helpful supporting components built around gRPC. Most of these projects are useful when building real-world applications using gRPC.</p>&#13;
