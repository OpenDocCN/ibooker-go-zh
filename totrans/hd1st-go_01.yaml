    is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you *are* able to learn and
    remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your
    brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t *feel* important
    to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing *over* and *over* and *over*, so
    I suppose it must be.”
  prefs: []

    different *types* of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big
    part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your
    brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words *within*
    the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption
    or in the body text) causes your brain to try to make sense of how the words and
    picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more
    chances for your brain to *get* that this is something worth paying attention
    to, and possibly recording.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when
    they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow
    along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily
    *care* that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if
    the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you
    experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees.
    No need to stay awake.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used ***pictures***, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As
    far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really *is* worth a thousand words. And
    when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text *in* the pictures because
    your brain works more effectively when the text is *within* the thing it refers
    to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the body text somewhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used ***redundancy***, saying the same thing in *different* ways and with
    different media types, and *multiple senses*, to increase the chance that the
    content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used concepts and pictures in ***unexpected*** ways because your brain is
    tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least *some* ***emotional***
    *content*, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of
    emotions. That which causes you to *feel* something is more likely to be remembered,
    even if that feeling is nothing more than a little ***humor***, ***surprise***,
    or ***interest.***
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used a personalized, ***conversational style***, because your brain is tuned
    to pay more attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks
    you’re passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re
    *reading*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We included ***activities***, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember
    more when you ***do*** things than when you *read* about things. And we made the
    exercises challenging-yet-doable, because that’s what most people prefer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used ***multiple learning styles***, because *you* might prefer step-by-step
    procedures, while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and
    someone else just wants to see an example. But regardless of your own learning
    preference, *everyone* benefits from seeing the same content represented in multiple
    ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We include content for ***both sides of your brain***, because the more of your
    brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer
    you can stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the
    other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer
    period of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we included ***stories*** and exercises that present ***more than one point
    of view,*** because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced
    to make evaluations and judgments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We included ***challenges***, with exercises, and by asking ***questions***
    that don’t always have a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn
    and remember when it has to *work* at something. Think about it—you can’t get
    your *body* in shape just by *watching* people at the gym. But we did our best
    to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the *right* things. That ***you’re
    not spending one extra dendrite*** processing a hard-to-understand example, or
    parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a person. And your brain pays more attention to *people* than it does to *things*.
