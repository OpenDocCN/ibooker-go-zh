<h1 class="calibre25">We know what your brain is thinking</h1>
<p class="calibre7">Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, <em class="calibre9">waiting</em> for something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive.</p>
<p class="calibre7">So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things you encounter? Everything it <em class="calibre9">can</em> to stop them from interfering with the brain’s <em class="calibre9">real</em> job—recording things that <em class="calibre9">matter</em>. It doesn’t bother saving the boring things; they never make it past the “this is obviously not important” filter.</p>
<p class="calibre7">How does your brain <em class="calibre9">know</em> what’s important? Suppose you’re out for a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you—what happens inside your head and body?</p>
<p class="calibre7">Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. <em class="calibre9">Chemicals surge</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre7">And that’s how your brain knows…</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="image" src="assets/f0xxvii-01.png" class="calibre4"/>
<h6 class="calibre5"/>
</div></figure>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">This must be important! Don’t forget it!</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">But imagine you’re at home or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger-free zone. You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, 10 days at the most.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s trying to make sure that this <em class="calibre9">obviously</em> unimportant content doesn’t clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really <em class="calibre9">big</em> things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you should never have posted those party photos on your Facebook page. And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey, brain, thank you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, no matter how little I’m registering on the emotional Richter scale right now, I really <em class="calibre9">do</em> want you to keep this stuff around.”</p>

<h5 class="calibre31">We think of a “Head First” reader as a <span class="calibre21">learner</span>.</h5>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">So what does it take to <em class="calibre26">learn</em> something? First, you have to <em class="calibre26">get</em> it, then make sure you don’t <em class="calibre26">forget</em> it. It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, <em class="calibre26">learning</em> takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Some of the Head First learning principles:</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Make it visual.</strong> Images are far more memorable than words alone, and make learning much more effective (up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). They also make things more understandable. <strong class="calibre8">Put the words within or near the graphics</strong> they relate to, rather than on the bottom or on another page, and learners will be up to <em class="calibre9">twice</em> as likely to solve problems related to the content.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Use a conversational and personalized style.</strong> In recent studies, students performed up to 40% better on post-learning tests if the content spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, conversational style rather than taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Which would <em class="calibre9">you</em> pay more attention to: a stimulating dinner-party companion, or a lecture?</p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Get the learner to think more deeply.</strong> In other words, unless you actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head. A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need challenges, exercises, and thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the brain and multiple senses.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Get—and keep—the reader’s attention.</strong> We’ve all had the “I really want to learn this, but I can’t stay awake past page one” experience. Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it’s not.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Touch their emotions.</strong> We now know that your ability to remember something is largely dependent on its emotional content. You remember what you care about. You remember when you <em class="calibre9">feel</em> something. No, we’re not talking heart-wrenching stories about a boy and his dog. We’re talking emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the…?” , and the feeling of “I rule!” that comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” Bob from Engineering <em class="calibre9">doesn’t</em>.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Metacognition: thinking about thinking" data-type="sect1" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="metacognition_thinking_about_thinking">
<h1 class="calibre25">Metacognition: thinking about thinking</h1>
<p class="calibre7">If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were <em class="calibre9">expected</em> to learn, but rarely <em class="calibre9">taught</em> to learn.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you really want to learn how to write Go programs. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time. If you want to use what you read in this book, you need to <em class="calibre9">remember</em> what you read. And for that, you’ve got to <em class="calibre9">understand</em> it. To get the most from this book, or <em class="calibre9">any</em> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <em class="calibre9">this</em> content.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="image" src="assets/f0xxix-01.png" class="calibre4"/>
<h6 class="calibre5"/>
</div></figure>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">So just how <em class="calibre26">DO</em> you get your brain to treat programming like it’s a hungry tiger?</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <em class="calibre9">are</em> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics if you keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <em class="calibre9">feel</em> important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing <em class="calibre9">over</em> and <em class="calibre9">over</em> and <em class="calibre9">over</em>, so I suppose it must be.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The faster way is to do <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">anything that increases brain activity</em></strong>, especially different <em class="calibre9">types</em> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <em class="calibre9">within</em> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to make sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <em class="calibre9">get</em> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p>
<p class="calibre7">A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <em class="calibre9">care</em> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning…</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Here’s what WE did" data-type="sect1" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="hereaposs_what_we_did">
<h1 class="calibre25">Here’s what WE did</h1>
<p class="calibre7">We used <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">pictures</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really <em class="calibre9">is</em> worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text <em class="calibre9">in</em> the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is <em class="calibre9">within</em> the thing it refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the body text somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We used <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">redundancy</em></strong>, saying the same thing in <em class="calibre9">different</em> ways and with different media types, and <em class="calibre9">multiple senses</em>, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We used concepts and pictures in <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">unexpected</em></strong> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least <em class="calibre9">some</em> <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">emotional</em></strong> <em class="calibre9">content</em>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to <em class="calibre9">feel</em> something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">humor</em></strong>, <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">surprise</em></strong>, or <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">interest.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">We used a personalized, <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">conversational style</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re <em class="calibre9">reading</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We included <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">activities</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">do</em></strong> things than when you <em class="calibre9">read</em> about things. And we made the exercises challenging-yet-doable, because that’s what most people prefer.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We used <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">multiple learning styles</em></strong>, because <em class="calibre9">you</em> might prefer step-by-step procedures, while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants to see an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, <em class="calibre9">everyone</em> benefits from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We include content for <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">both sides of your brain</em></strong>, because the more of your brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="calibre7">And we included <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">stories</em></strong> and exercises that present <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">more than one point of view,</em></strong> because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make evaluations and judgments.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We included <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">challenges</em></strong>, with exercises, and by asking <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">questions</em></strong> that don’t always have a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to <em class="calibre9">work</em> at something. Think about it—you can’t get your <em class="calibre9">body</em> in shape just by <em class="calibre9">watching</em> people at the gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the <em class="calibre9">right</em> things. That <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">you’re not spending one extra dendrite</em></strong> processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.</p>
<p class="calibre7">We used <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">people</em></strong>. In stories, examples, pictures, etc., because, well, <em class="calibre9">you’re</em> a person. And your brain pays more attention to <em class="calibre9">people</em> than it does to <em class="calibre9">things</em>.</p>

<ol class="calibre27">
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Don’t just <em class="calibre9">read</em>. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine that someone really <em class="calibre9">is</em> asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of learning and remembering.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Do the exercises. Write your own notes.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">We put them in, but if we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don’t just <em class="calibre9">look</em> at the exercises. <strong class="calibre8">Use a pencil</strong>. There’s plenty of evidence that physical activity <em class="calibre9">while</em> learning can increase the learning.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Read “There Are No Dumb Questions.”</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">That means all of them. They’re not optional sidebars, <strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">they’re part of the core content!</em></strong> Don’t skip them.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Make this the last thing you read before bed. Or at least the last challenging thing.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens <em class="calibre9">after</em> you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put in something new during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Talk about it. Out loud.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If you’re trying to understand something, or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were reading about it.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Drink water. Lots of it.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration (which can happen before you ever feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Listen to your brain.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Feel something.</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Your brain needs to know that this <em class="calibre9">matters</em>. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is <em class="calibre9">still</em> better than feeling nothing at all.</p></li>
<li class="calibre28"><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8">Write a lot of code!</strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">There’s only one way to learn to develop Go programs: <strong class="calibre8">write a lot of code</strong>. And that’s what you’re going to do throughout this book. Coding is a skill, and the only way to get good at it is to practice. We’re going to give you a lot of practice: every chapter has exercises that pose a problem for you to solve. Don’t just skip over them—a lot of the learning happens when you solve the exercises. We included a solution to each exercise—don’t be afraid to <strong class="calibre8">peek at the solution</strong> if you get stuck! (It’s easy to get snagged on something small.) But try to solve the problem before you look at the solution. And definitely get it working before you move on to the next part of the book.</p></li>

<p class="calibre7">This is a learning experience, not a reference book.

<p class="calibre7">Most developers discover Go <em class="calibre9">after</em> they’ve learned some other programming language. (They often come seeking refuge from that other language.) We touch on the basics enough that a complete beginner can get by, but we don’t go into great detail on what a variable is, or how an <code class="calibre20">if</code> statement works.

<h2 class="calibre29"><strong class="calibre8">We don’t cover every type, function, and package ever created.</strong></h2>
<p class="calibre7">Go comes with a <em class="calibre9">lot</em> of software packages built in. Sure, they’re all interesting, but we couldn’t cover them all even if this book was <em class="calibre9">twice</em> as long. Our focus is on the core types and functions that <em class="calibre9">matter</em> to you, the beginner. We make sure you have a deep understanding of them, and confidence that you know how and when to use them. In any case, once you’re done with <em class="calibre9">Head First Go</em>, you’ll be able to pick up any reference book and get up to speed quickly on the packages we left out.</p>

<p class="calibre7">The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book.

<p class="calibre7">One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to <em class="calibre9">really</em> get it. And we want you to finish the book remembering what you’ve learned.

<p class="calibre7">It’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of code looking for the two lines you need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown in the smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and simple. So don’t expect the code to be robust, or even complete.

I loved the series when I encountered it more than a decade ago, but never imagined I might be writing for it. Thank you for creating this amazing style of teaching!</p>
<p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre26">At O’Reilly:</strong></em></p>
<p class="calibre7">Thanks to everyone at O’Reilly who made this happen, particularly editor <strong class="calibre8">Jeff Bleiel</strong>, and to <strong class="calibre8">Kristen Brown</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">Rachel Monaghan</strong>, and the rest of the production team.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre26">Technical reviewers:</strong></em></p>
<p class="calibre7">Everyone makes mistakes, but luckily I have tech reviewers <strong class="calibre8">Tim Heckman, Edward Yue Shung Wong</strong>, and <strong class="calibre8">Stefan Pochmann</strong> to catch all of mine. You will never know how many problems they found, because I swiftly destroyed all the evidence. But their help and feedback were definitely necessary and are forever appreciated!</p>
<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre8"><em class="calibre26">And more thanks:</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre7">Thanks to <strong class="calibre8">Leo Richardson</strong> for additional proofreading.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Perhaps most importantly, thanks to <strong class="calibre8">Christine, Courtney, Bryan, Lenny</strong>, and <strong class="calibre8">Jeremy</strong> for their patience and support (for two books now)!</p>
