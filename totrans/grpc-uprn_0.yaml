- en: Nowadays software applications are often connected with each other over computer
    networks using inter-process communication technologies. gRPC is a modern inter-process
    communication style based on high-performance RPCs (remote procedure calls) for
    building distributed applications and microservices. With the advent of microservices
    and cloud native applications, the adoption of gRPC is exponentially growing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the increasing adoption of gRPC, we felt that developers need a comprehensive
    book on gRPC, a book that you can use as the ultimate reference guide in every
    stage of the development cycle of your gRPC applications. There are a lot of resources
    and code samples for gRPC all over the place (documentation, blogs, articles,
    conference talks, and so on), but there’s no single resource that you can use
    to build gRPC applications. Also, there aren’t any resources on the internals
    of the gRPC protocol and how it works under the hood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wrote this book to overcome those challenges and give you a comprehensive
    understanding of the fundamentals of gRPC, how it differs from conventional inter-process
    communication technologies, real-world gRPC communication patterns, how to build
    gRPC applications using Go and Java, how it works under the hood, how to run gRPC
    applications in production, and how gRPC works with Kubernetes and the rest of
    the ecosystem.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is most directly relevant to developers who are building distributed
    applications and microservices using different inter-process communication technologies.
    When it comes to building such applications and services, developers need to learn
    the fundamentals of gRPC, when and how to use it for inter-service communication,
    best practices for running gRPC services in production, and so on. Also, architects
    who are adopting microservices or cloud native architecture and designing how
    the services should communicate will get a lot of insight from the book because
    it compares and contrasts gRPC with other technologies and provides guidelines
    on when to use and when to avoid it.

- en: We assume that both developers and architects have a basic understanding of
    the fundamentals of distributed computing such as inter-process communication
    techniques, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and microservices.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is written in such a way that the theoretical concepts are explained
    using real-world use cases. Throughout the book, we have extensively used code
    examples featuring Go and Java to give readers hands-on experience with each of
    the concepts that they learn. We have organized the book into eight chapters.
