    lets us monitor them. Consul lets us discover them. Jaeger lets us trace the relationships
    between them. These are just a few examples, but there are many, many more, all
    representative of a new generation of technologies: all of them are “cloud native,”
    and all of them are written in *Go*.'

- en: The term “cloud native” feels ambiguous and buzzwordy, but it actually has a
    pretty specific definition. According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
    a sub-foundation of the renowned Linux Foundation, a cloud native application
    is one that’s designed to be scalable in the face of a wildly changing load, resilient
    in the face of environmental uncertainty, and manageable in the face of ever-changing
    requirements. In other words, a cloud native application is built for life in
    a cruel, uncertain universe.

- en: Incorporating lessons learned from years of building cloud-based software, Go
    was created about a decade ago as the first major language designed specifically
    for the development of cloud native software. This was largely because the common
    server languages in use at the time simply weren’t a great fit for writing the
    kinds of distributed, process-intensive applications that Google produces a lot
    of.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since that time, Go has emerged as the *lingua franca* of cloud native development,
    being used in everything from Docker to Harbor, Kubernetes to Consul, InfluxDB
    to CockroachDB. Ten out of fifteen of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s
    graduated projects, and forty-two of sixty-two^([1](preface01.xhtml#idm45983644835896))
    of its projects overall, are written mostly or entirely in Go. And more arrive
    every day.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is directed at intermediate-to-advanced developers, particularly web
    application engineers and DevOps specialists/site reliability engineers. Many
    will have been using Go to build web services, but may be unfamiliar with the
    subtleties of cloud native development—or even have a clear idea of what “cloud
    native” is—and have subsequently found their services to be difficult to manage,
    deploy, or observe. For these readers, this work will provide a solid foundation
    in not just how to build a cloud native service, but it will show why these techniques
    matter at all, as well as offer concrete examples to understand this sometimes
    abstract topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s expected that many readers may be more familiar with other languages, but
    lured by Go’s reputation as the language of cloud native development. For these
    readers, this book will present best practices for adopting Go as their cloud
    native development language, and help them solve their own cloud native management
    and deployment issues.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The way that applications are designed, built, and deployed is changing. Demands
    of scale are forcing developers to spread their services’ efforts across legions
    of servers: the industry is going “cloud native.” But this introduces a host of
    new problems: how do you develop or deploy or manage a service running on ten
    servers? A hundred? A thousand? Unfortunately, the existing books in the “cloud
    native” space focus on abstract design principles, and contain only rudimentary
    examples of how to do any of this, or none at all. This book seeks to fill a need
    in the marketplace for a practical demonstration of complex cloud native design
    principles.'
