<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s a magical time to be a technologist.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We have Docker to build containers, and Kubernetes to orchestrate them. Prometheus lets us monitor them. Consul lets us discover them. Jaeger lets us trace the relationships between them. These are just a few examples, but there are many, many more, all representative of a new generation of technologies: all of them are “cloud native,” and all of them are written in <em>Go</em>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The term “cloud native” feels ambiguous and buzzwordy, but it actually has a pretty specific definition. According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, a sub-foundation of the renowned Linux Foundation, a cloud native application is one that’s designed to be scalable in the face of a wildly changing load, resilient in the face of environmental uncertainty, and manageable in the face of ever-changing requirements. In other words, a cloud native application is built for life in a cruel, uncertain universe.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Incorporating lessons learned from years of building cloud-based software, Go was created about a decade ago as the first major language designed specifically for the development of cloud native software. This was largely because the common server languages in use at the time simply weren’t a great fit for writing the kinds of distributed, process-intensive applications that Google produces a lot of.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since that time, Go has emerged as the <em>lingua franca</em> of cloud native development, being used in everything from Docker to Harbor, Kubernetes to Consul, InfluxDB to CockroachDB. Ten out of fifteen of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s graduated projects, and forty-two of sixty-two<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45983644835896-marker" href="preface01.xhtml#idm45983644835896">1</a></sup> of its projects overall, are written mostly or entirely in Go.&#13;
And more arrive every day.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is directed at intermediate-to-advanced developers, particularly web application engineers and DevOps specialists/site reliability engineers. Many will have been using Go to build web services, but may be unfamiliar with the subtleties of cloud native development—or even have a clear idea of what “cloud native” is—and have subsequently found their services to be difficult to manage, deploy, or observe. For these readers, this work will provide a solid foundation in not just how to build a cloud native service, but it will show why these techniques matter at all, as well as offer concrete examples to understand this sometimes abstract topic.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s expected that many readers may be more familiar with other languages, but lured by Go’s reputation as the language of cloud native development. For these readers, this book will present best practices for adopting Go as their cloud native development language, and help them solve their own cloud native management and deployment issues.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The way that applications are designed, built, and deployed is changing. Demands of scale are forcing developers to spread their services’ efforts across legions of servers: the industry is going “cloud native.” But this introduces a host of new problems: how do you develop or deploy or manage a service running on ten servers? A hundred? A thousand? Unfortunately, the existing books in the “cloud native” space focus on abstract design principles, and contain only rudimentary examples of how to do any of this, or none at all. This book seeks to fill a need in the marketplace for a practical demonstration of complex cloud native design principles.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>First and foremost, I’d like to thank my wife and son. You’re the motivation for every good thing I’ve done since you’ve entered my life, and the guiding stars that let me keep my direction true and my eyes on the sky.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To my dad, who we lost recently. You were the closest thing to a true Renaissance man I’ve ever known while still managing to be the kindest, most humble person I’ve ever known. I still want to be just like you when I grow up.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Mary. Who feels his absence more profoundly than anyone. You’re family, and you’ll always be family, even if I don’t call you as often as I should. Dad would be so proud of your strength and grace.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Sarah. I’m always amazed by your strength and grit. Your sharp mind has made you both my staunchest ally and fiercest adversary since you could first speak. Don’t tell Nathan, but you’re my favorite sibling.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Nathan. If we all inherited one third of dad’s genius, you got his heart. I don’t say it often enough, but I’m so proud of you and your accomplishments. Don’t tell Sarah, but you’re my favorite sibling.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Mom. You’re strong and smart, colorful and unconventional. Thank you for teaching me to always do what actually needs doing, regardless of what people think. Stay weird, and remember to feed the chickens.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Albert. You have a huge heart and a bottomless well of patience. Thank you for joining our family; we’re better for having you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To the rest of my family. I don’t get to see you nearly as often as I’d like, and I miss you all dearly, but you’re always there when I need you. Thank you for celebrating the wins with me, and for supporting me through the losses.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Walt and Alvaro, whom I can’t seem to get away from, even by changing jobs. Thank you for your enthusiastic support when I need it, and your stark realism when I need that instead. You both make me a better engineer. Also, thank you for &#13;
<span class="keep-together">introducing</span> me to Will Wight’s Cradle series, and for the crippling addiction that &#13;
<span class="keep-together">followed</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To “Jeff Classic,” “New Jeff,” Alex, Markan, Priyanka, Sam, Owen, Matt M., Marius, Peter, Rohit, and all of my friends and colleagues at Flatiron Health. Thanks for going beyond just allowing me to divert my focus onto this endeavor, but also for supporting me and my work, serving as sounding boards, acting as beta readers and critics, and for both encouraging me and being my enablers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To all of my friends at CoffeeOps in New York and around the world. You’ve graciously allowed me to bounce thoughts off of you and to challenge you, and you’ve challenged me in return. This book is better because of your input.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To Liz Fong-Jones, the renowned observability expert and oracle. Your guidance, direction, and code samples were invaluable, and without your generosity this book would have been a lot harder to write, and the result would have been a lot poorer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To my technical reviewers Lee Atchison, Alvaro Atienza, David Nicponski, Natalie Pistunovich, and James Quigley. Thank you for having the patience to read every &#13;
<span class="keep-together">single</span> word I wrote (even the footnotes). This is a much better book because of your sharp eyes and hard work.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And finally, to the entire team of hardworking editors and artists at O’Reilly Media whom I was fortunate enough to work with, especially Amelia Blevins, Danny Elfanbaum, and Zan McQuade. 2020 turned out to be a very interesting year, but your kindness, patience, and support carried me through it.</p>&#13;
